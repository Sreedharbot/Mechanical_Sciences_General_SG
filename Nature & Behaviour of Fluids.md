# "Nature & Behaviour of Fluids"

Word - **"Fluids"** can be used for __Gaseous__ and __Liquid__ substances.

>Question 1: What are gas? and how it varies from Liquid. 🤔

**The Classification of gases, liquid and solids are made based on the molecular attractions.**

* In Solids - Molecules are bonded togethere. Their Van-der-Waal Forces are **very strong**,which indicates the attraction froces of molecules are high.
* In Liquids - Molecules are loosely bonded, but they are not bonded like solids. They do experiences near by molecues attractive froce like dipoles. 
* In Gases - Mocules are very loosely bonded, they have least Van-der-Waal forces between the molecules or atoms.  
 
 > "Van_der_waal Froce = Solids > Liquids > Gaseous"

In general Fluids have **"Weak Van-der-waal Forces"**

But their is one big differences, with gaseous and liquids that is. 

* Liquids can't be compressed when volume is increased, but in the case of gas can be compressed when volume increased. 

Here is a Example; 
when a Balloon is filled with water completely, slight press by your hand or try to drop the balloon at top of your head. Now, same experiment with air.

> Question from the Experiment! 🤔
The one of both Balloons are completely filled with air and other with water, where their volumes are equal. But why the balloon with water burst, when I slightly pressed at it.

**Obvious Answers**: 😁
* Water has mass so it bust!

But their is another thing, to notices which is "why air didn't burst!". **"when more pressing is done!"**. 

One of the reasons **Given by Scientist**, **Are the gaseous have more empty space than water**, in which higher the empty space, gives higher **compressibility**. Moreover, all gaseous have lesser van der waal forces which mean more space.

>  ↑ Volume of Gas =  ↑ More Space  =  ↑ Highly Compressible  (Driectly Proportional, "Volume-Compressibilty"")

In terms of above method, water / liquids has less space between atoms compare to gases. Hences, 

> ↑ Volume of Water = ↓ Less Space = ↓ Less Compressible (Innvers Proportional, "Volume-Compressibilty") 

# Pressure
In general, pressure is **"Force per Area"**, which is "F/A".
